# SpeedyVid Extension
A simple chromium/chrome extension to increase the speed of videos without shady side effects &/or API calls.  


_TODO:_ 
- Rebuild popup (_& project_) in React. _For a more beautiful interface_
- Store speed. As any time the popup is re-opened the current speed is reset to the default.

# Installation/Usage
- **Download** the [zip of this project](https://github.com/salvadoruriel/speedyVid-extension/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
- Unzip it. _(& always scan downloaded files before using them via [virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload))_
- In the extensions page of your chromium browser **enable Developer mode**.  
- Click _Load unpacked_, browse to the unzipped folder & select it.  
**That's it! Enjoy!**  
_(Pin the extension if you aren't seeing it)._
